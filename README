Light weight Arduino or Ardiuino like board interface via Serial io.

It is meant to be smaller than protocols like Firmata. Due to it's size and
simplicity, it should run on many smaller controller boards and processors.

The interface gives access to the following Wiring/Arduino functions:

    pinMode
    digitalWrite
    digitalRead
    analogWrite
    analogRead

With these few functions, you can do most things needed in many projects.
It should be easy to extend, and add other built-in or user functions.

To use, compile the file in the arduino folder of the project, to your
controller. You can then run one of the examples with the controller hooked up
to your computer's usb port. Just change the example to use whatever comport
your controller is on.

I have tested it with a real Uno, a clone Uno, a Nano clone with an Atmega168
and a Ti Launch Pad Stellaris. It compiled and worked on each. You have to dig
around for the Ti Pin numbers, but testing Pin 30 for the RED_LED worked. I plan
to make board mappings in the client libraries.

TODO:
  - Documentation.
  - Finish the Python library.
  - Add a Nodejs library.
  - More examples.
  - Add optional servo version.
  - Add Personality settings for different controller boards. This will be a
    client side change only.
