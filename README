Light weight Arduino or Ardiuino like board interface via Serial io.

It is meant to be smaller than protocols like Firmata. Due to it's size and
simplicity, it should run on many smaller controller boards and processors.

The interface gives access to the following Wiring/Arduino functions:

    pinMode
    digitalWrite
    digitalRead
    analogWrite
    analogRead

With these few functions, you can do most things needed in many projects.
It should be easy to extend, and add other built-in or user functions.

To use, compile the file in the arduino folder of the project, to your
controller. You can then run one of the examples with the controller hooked up
to your computer's usb port. Just change the example to use whatever comport
your controller is on.
